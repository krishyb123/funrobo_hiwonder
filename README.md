# Python Library for the Hiwonder 5-DOF Mobile Manipulator

This repository provides the python libraries for interfacing with the Hiwonder 5-DOF mobile manipulator. The robot platform has an onboard **Raspberry Pi 4B** which serves as the main compute unit of the system. The 5-DOF arm are driven by serial bus servos controlled over serial while the mobile base is driven by DC motors controlled by a custom driver board with communication over I2C.

Your project development will be done onboard the Raspberry Pi ideally over **SSH protocol**.

## Setting up the onboard Raspberry Pi

#### Step 0: Connect to the Raspberry Pi from your laptop over SSH
TO BE ADDED

  **The password is `FunR0b0!`** 

- SSH troubleshooting:
  - Make sure you are connected to the Olin Robotics network (It should work on Olin, but Olin Robotics may be faster/more stable).
  - Make sure OpenSSH Client and OpenSSH Server are installed (should be installed by default on Mac/Linux, may need to be installed under `Settings > System > Optional Features` in Windows).
  - Make sure the OpenSSH folder is added to your path. Should be `C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH` in Windows.
  - Check the SD card to make sure the number physically written on it matches what you expect.


#### Step 1: Create a workspace and get the repositories
- Create a workspace
```bash
mkdir ~/funrobo_ws 
# this will be your default workspace for this class
```

- Get the repositories: **funrobo_hiwonder** and your forked version of **funrobo_kinematics**
```bash
# go into the workspace folder
cd funrobo_ws

git clone https://github.com/OlinCollege-FunRobo/funrobo_hiwonder.git
git clone <your funrobo_kinematics repo>
```

#### Step 2: Create a conda environment from **funrobo_hiwonder** 
- Create the virtual environment
```bash
cd funrobo_hiwonder
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
- Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate funrobo_hw
```

### Step 3: Install both packages, following the order below
```bash
cd ~/funrobo_ws
pip install -e funrobo_kinematics
pip install -e funrobo_hiwonder
```

#### Step 4: Run the example scripts
- If setup worked well, you should be able to run the main script with the command below:
```bash
cd funrobo_hiwonder
python examples/joystick_control.py
```
